                <h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
                <h4 class="program">I was tasked to analyze Lucie Glaister website and make suggestions on how to improve the overall usability as the client recognised there is a room for improvement. My main goal was to increase the engagement. It led me to redesigning the pages and extending the feature to allow users create profiles which are not functional on the current website and will be helpful for a client to obtain users emails and use the email to send a newsletter. I also focused on creating features when the user is able adding favorite products to the wishlist with a sharing option.</h4>
                <h3>METHOD</h3>
                <H4 style="font-weight: bold">Usability testing</H4>
                <h4>To test my assumptions of where the possible improvements lay, I focused on the following tasks: I conducted usability tests on 3 participants. They were 2 female and 1 male between the age 30 and 45 with a passion for high quality food.
                <h4>Purchase - Find the best food product with premium wine, chocolate and delicates. </h4>
                <h4>Subscribe to newsletter - People with passion for premium food, looking for not only handmade high quality food, but they also want to buy products which are made from seasonal food. </h4>

            <h3><strong>Low-Fidelity Wireframes and Mid-Fidelity Wireframes<strong></h3>
            <h4 style="font-weight: normal">First I sketched out a few ideas on paper, I selected and used what made the most sense and to get a good overview of the product I created Low-fidelity Wireframes. I designed a mobile first responsive web app and for that I choose 8 column grids. To create not  only Wireframes, but also <strong>Style Guide</strong> and prototypes I used <strong>Figma</strong></h3>

            <h4 style="font-weight: normal">I created a style guide to be more consistent and efficient while working with Figma. Also during creating a style guide I felt the importance to keep it clear and organized not only for other UX designers, but also for developers</h3>

            <h3><strong>Wireframes</strong></h3>
            <h4 style="font-weight: normal">I created a wireframe where you can see the user flow from the home page, adding products to a wishlist, sharing wishlist, buying a product, with a simple card to thank customers for buying the product</h4>

        <h4 class="create" style="font-weight: normal">In the image can be seen the whole process from the sketch to the final version.In the first version of wireframes I created a navigation menu, which was not very practical at this project. Also in the earlier iteration the color scheme was too light and the design did not follow the color of brand name. I was learning along the way and decided for a warmer color</h4>

Based on their orders, and wishlish will see the “just for you” recomendation. Also categories are displayed in a way that user on mobile phone can see clearly category options. I added new feature by clicking on a heart add favorite products to a wishlist with sharing option</h5>
        <%= image_tag "mctwo.png", :class => "journey img-fluid justify-content-center" %>
        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 60px">In the category section I created microinteraction - horizontal scrollbar, to keep the website more engaging, which positively contributing to the look-and-feel of a product</h5>

        <h5 style="margin-bottom: 60px">Stars on the original website could be confusing, because it is not possible to rating the product. Instead I added reviews. In case user don’t find suitable product, can look into a similar products which is placed on the bottom of the page</h5>

        <h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: normal">This project helped me to develop UX design skills and how to bring together knowledge I learned as a service designer, which is conducting research, observing user behavior, creating personas, prototype, iterate and start over until the final project will meet client expectation</h4>
